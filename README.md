# Just Don't Die Game

CMSC391/COAR463 Game Development - Minor Project 2

This repository contains code for our game Just Don't Die, a side scroller with two chapters. In the first one, you collect other buddies/fighters and jump over obstacles. Once you reach the finish line, you enter a battle in which you can switch between playing as yourself or the buddies you picked up. Use WASD or arrow controls to move for both parts, and use the space bar to attack in the battle portion. Try to reach the finish line for both levels, and beat the boss!
